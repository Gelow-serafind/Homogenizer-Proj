## Project Overview

This project implements a homogenizer controller prototype using the HK32F0301MF4P7C MCU. The core design is based on:

- `SysTick` 1 ms timing with a task array polling scheduler
- EC11 rotary encoder A/B 4x decoding plus short/long press key detection
- PWM motor speed control
- TM1729 LCD-style numeric display
- UART periodic status output

## Key Features

- Encoder rotation adjusts the currently selected parameter
- Short press enters setting mode or switches fields
- Long press (3 seconds) starts or pauses the motor
- Running mode decrements countdown timer; reaching zero pauses the motor
- Setting mode allows editing speed, minutes, and seconds
- 5 seconds of inactivity exits setting mode and applies changes
- When editing speed during running, PWM preview follows the edited speed

## Actual Behavior

1. On power-up, the MCU initializes UART, TIM1 PWM, EC11 GPIO, and TM1729, then displays `1234` as an LCD startup test pattern.
2. The main loop polls task handlers by period: encoder, application logic, PWM, UART print, LCD refresh, and idle.
3. UART prints a status line every 100 ms, including mode, speed, time, key state, and encoder position.
4. In `SETTING` mode, the current field blinks and a 5-second inactivity timeout exits and commits settings.
5. Long press for 3 seconds: if currently `RUNNING`, the system pauses; otherwise it starts the motor and enters `RUNNING`.
6. In running mode, TIM1 PWM output reflects the running speed; in paused/idle mode, PWM output is zero.

## Logic Details

### Input Handling

- `Task_Encoder()` runs every 2 ms:
  - Reads encoder A/B on `PC3`/`PC4` and performs 4x decoding.
  - Reads key on `PC5` with 3-tick debouncing.
  - A 3-second hold generates `KeyLongPressEvent`; releasing generates `KeyShortPressEvent`.

### State Machine

- `IDLE`: standby mode, PWM output is 0.
- `SETTING`: configuration mode, editable speed/minute/second fields with blink.
- `RUNNING`: motor is active, countdown decrements once per second.
- `PAUSED`: motor stopped, current configuration preserved.

### Key Actions

- Short press:
  - If already in `SETTING`, switches field: `SPEED -> MIN -> SEC -> SPEED`.
  - Otherwise enters `SETTING` mode.
- Long press:
  - If in `RUNNING`, pauses the motor.
  - Otherwise starts the motor.

### Start / Pause Behavior

- Start:
  - If countdown is zero, reloads from current configured minutes and seconds.
  - Sets `MotorSpeedPercent` to the configured speed.
  - Triggers PWM update.
- Pause:
  - Sets `MotorSpeedPercent` to 0.
  - PWM output goes to zero.
  - Countdown stops decrementing.

### Setting Mode Behavior

- Entering `SETTING` mode saves the current countdown as a backup so time does not continue during editing.
- When exiting `SETTING` mode:
  - If coming from `RUNNING`, it returns to running.
  - If speed was edited while running, the running PWM preview follows the edited speed.
  - The countdown value updates once editing completes.
  - If coming from `PAUSED` or `IDLE`, it returns to that state or idle.
- A 5-second inactivity timeout exits setting mode and commits changes.

### Countdown and Idle Task

- `Task_Idle()` decrements `CountdownSec` only when `RUNNING` and only once per second.
- When `CountdownSec` reaches zero, automatic pause is invoked.

## PWM and Display Logic

### TIM1 PWM

- PWM uses `TIM1 CH2` on pin `PD2`.
- The frequency target is `PWM_TARGET_FREQ_HZ = 17570UL`.
- `Task_PWM()` updates CCR2 only when `DutyChanged` is set.
- Output rules:
  - `RUNNING`: uses `MotorSpeedPercent`.
  - `SETTING` while from `RUNNING`:
    - If speed is being edited, preview the edited speed.
    - Otherwise use the current running speed.
  - Other modes: output zero.

### TM1729 Display

- `Task_TM1729()` refreshes the display every 50 ms.
- Display behavior:
  - `SETTING` with speed editing: speed is shown and blinks; RPM indicator is on.
  - `SETTING` with time editing: minutes and seconds are shown, selected field blinks; RPM indicator is off.
  - Other states: show current speed or zero with RPM indicator on.

## UART Status Output

- `Task_Print()` prints one line every 100 ms including:
  - `MODE`, `SPEED`, `TIME`, `KEY`, and `POS`
- In setting mode, the currently blinking field may show placeholder dashes.
